# Skull Engine
Welcome to the Skull Engine, a game engine made from scratch! It's a personal project that helps me understand C++ better and how to use it efficiently and how game engine is made (which it's very interesting!).
For now I used GLFW and ImGUI for making the windows and used OpenGL to render a triangle, and also has a console where logging happens using spdlog. 
Still WIP...
